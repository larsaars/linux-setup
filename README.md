# linux-setup
My linux setup including vim config (based on [this](https://github.com/ny64/vim-setup)) etc. Be sure to always be in home dir (`cd ~`) when installing!
> Note: I'm using the WSL with Kali-Linux for this setup.

Find detailed vim shortcut list [here](https://gist.github.com/larsaars/b3ec6df54fbb0ce31b740c8afbe949e9).

## installation
### zsh and other necessary packages
    sudo apt-get install zsh git vim g++ gcc gdb cgdb default-jdk
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#### fixing the WSL font / icon bug with zsh (on Windows):
1. download and install the ttf fonts from [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono) manually on your Windows PC
2. set terminal default settings to DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline.ttf under Right Click on Terminal > Default values > Font
### installing powerlevel10k
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
    echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
    zsh restart
    cd ~
Configure powerlevel10k as you want it (you can reconfigure it anytime with `p10k configure`).
### installing external language beautifiers (for vim)
> Note: apt-get package manager has to be replaced with yours (on mac e.g. with `brew install`).
